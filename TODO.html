Data transfer within app
1. Re-look at the parsedValues mechanism, change it to be able to render Date objects. Subsequently change other functions to render Dates as well

Enum
1. Migrate the deployment url to an enum
2. Migrate the names of each html file to an enum

Loan Policy
1. Find some way of storing and parsing (with loops) the loan policy block 

App.approve and reject
1. Figure out a way to pass the source sheet to the function without putting it inside the approver JSON, and without manually doing the if else
- Perhaps do the manual if else in js.html
2. Combine the approve and reject functions since they are very similar, or at least create some functions to reduce code duplication
3. Use loan objects instead of the loanRecord array in the moveToSheet() function (Need to code a function to change a loan object to a data array)

Documentation
1. Write-up documentation for onFormSubmit, approve and reject

Webapp-related
1. Optimise how index.html works
2. Form validation for searching for borrowerEmail (client-side + server-side)
3. Only allowing authorised users to access index.html

TODOs by Alfie
1. Only allow emails in the Authorised Users sheet to access index.html
2. In the Outstanding loans sheet, each loan row should have a corresponding return button
